            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <p>In like manner as the Bill against Root and Branch, brought on by Tumultuous clamors and schismatical terrors, which could never pass till both Houses were sufficiently thinned and over awed.</p>
            <p>And in the 17th. Chapter, his Majesty men<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions his consenting against the Bishops sitting in the House of Parliament, as one of the three things which so much troubled him, putting it in the same Scale with his permitting the shed<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding of the innocent blood of the Earl of Straf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ford.</p>

            <p>They humbly remonstrate and protest before God, your Majesty, and the Noble Lords and Peers now as<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sembled in Parliament, That they have an indubitate Right to sit and vote in the House of Lords, so are they, if they may be protected from force and violence, most ready and willing to perform their duties accordingly. And that they doe abominate all actions or opinions tending to Popery, and the maintenance thereof; as also, all propension and inclination to any malignant party, or any other side or party whatsoever, to the which their own reasons and conscience shall not move them to adhere.</p>
            <p>But whereas they have been at several times violent<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly menaced, affronted and assaulted by multitudes of people in their coming to perform their Services in that Honourable House, and lately chased away and put in danger of their lives, and can find no redresse or prote<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction, upon sundry complaints made to both Houses in these particulars.</p>
            <p>They likewise humbly protest before your Majesty, and the noble House of Peers, that saving unto them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>selves all their Rights and Interests of fitting and voting in that House at other times, they dare not sit or vote in the House of Peers until your Majesty shall further secure them from all affronts, indignities and dangers in the premisses</p>
